                        I am an inerpreter from two languages: french and english, but specially for you changed my life and studied HTML and CSS. Now I would gladly lend my service to you. 
                        <br />
                        There are plenty of reasons to hire me. One of the most prominent is that none but me could offer you the personal touch which goes beyond your expectations!
                        <br />
                        As mentioned before I happen to be an interpreter. What difference does it make if you are looking for a web-developer? It's simple: I can easily interprete your wishes into a web-site and make it look and function exactly as you want.

                    <h1>What exactly are my skills?</h1>
                    <h3>I can do websites!</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main reasons to hire me are my ability to translate your website and my ability to understand your demands.
                        <br/>
                        I can do miracles with my fingers not only in bed, but also on web. You may feel free to examine my previous projects, after doing this you will surely come to a conclusion that there is no better developer than me.
                        <br/>
                        I can also work with Bootstrapt and React frameworks (no I can't, but if I won't write it, you won't hire me, anyway if I'll need to, I'll copypaste some code from the internet and present it as my own)
